In the nucleus, the RNA exosome complex is involved in proper maturation of stable RNA species such as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA, in the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding 'pervasive' transcripts, such as antisense RNA species and promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and of mRNAs with processing defects, thereby limiting or excluding their export to the cytoplasm. The RNA exosome may be involved in Ig class switch recombination (CSR) and/or Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) by targeting AICDA deamination activity to transcribed dsDNA substrates. In the cytoplasm, the RNA exosome complex is involved in general mRNA turnover and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3' untranslated regions, and in RNA surveillance pathways, preventing translation of aberrant mRNAs. It seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. EXOSC10 has 3'-5' exonuclease activity (By similarity).

Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268). IgD is the major antigen receptor isotype on the surface of most peripheral B-cells, where it is coexpressed with IgM. The membrane-bound IgD (mIgD) induces the phosphorylation of CD79A and CD79B by the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases. Soluble IgD (sIgD) concentration in serum below those of IgG, IgA, and IgM but much higher than that of IgE. IgM and IgD molecules present on B cells have identical V regions and antigen-binding sites. After the antigen binds to the B-cell receptor, the secreted form sIgD is shut off. IgD is a potent inducer of TNF, IL1B, and IL1RN. IgD also induces release of IL6, IL10, and LIF from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Monocytes seem to be the main producers of cytokines in vitro in the presence of IgD (PubMed:8774350, PubMed:10702483, PubMed:11282392).

"IGHM","Immunoglobulins (Ig) are the antigen recognition molecules of B cells. An Ig molecule is made up of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains (see MIM 147200) joined by disulfide bonds so that each heavy chain is linked to a light chain and the 2 heavy chains are linked together. Each Ig heavy chain has an N-terminal variable (V) region containing the antigen-binding site and a C-terminal constant (C) region, encoded by an individual C region gene, that determines the isotype of the antibody and provides effector or signaling functions. The heavy chain V region is encoded by 1 each of 3 types of genes: V genes (see MIM 147070), joining (J) genes (see MIM 147010), and diversity (D) genes (see MIM 146910). The C region genes are clustered downstream of the V region genes within the heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. The IGHM gene encodes the C region of the mu heavy chain, which defines the IgM isotype. Naive B cells express the transmembrane forms of IgM and IgD (see IGHD; MIM 1471770) on their surface. During an antibody response, activated B cells can switch to the expression of individual downstream heavy chain C region genes by a process of somatic recombination known as isotype switching. In addition, secreted Ig forms that act as antibodies can be produced by alternative RNA processing of the heavy chain C region sequences. Although the membrane forms of all Ig isotypes are monomeric, secreted IgM forms pentamers, and occasionally hexamers, in plasma (summary by Janeway et al., 2005).[supplied by OMIM, Aug 2010]","                                            IGHM (Immunoglobulin Heavy Constant Mu) is a Protein Coding gene.

IgM antibodies play an important role in primary defense mechanisms. They have been shown to be involved in early recognition of external invaders like bacteria and viruses, cellular waste and modified self, as well as in recognition and elimination of precancerous and cancerous lesions. The membrane-bound form is found in the majority of normal B-cells alongside with IgD. Membrane-bound IgM induces the phosphorylation of CD79A and CD79B by the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases. It may cause death of cells by apoptosis. It is also found in soluble form, which represents about 30% of the total serum immunoglobulins where it is found almost exclusively as a homopentamer. After the antigen binds to the B-cell receptor, the secreted form is secreted in large amounts (PubMed:3137579, PubMed:16895553).

"TRDC","T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both the alpha and delta loci include V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments and the delta locus also includes diversity (D) segments. The delta locus is situated within the alpha locus, between the alpha V and J segments. During T cell development, the delta chain is synthesized by a recombination event at the DNA level joining a D segment with a J segment; a V segment is then joined to the D-J gene. The alpha chain is synthesized by recombination joining a single V segment with a J segment. For both chains, the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Five variable segments can be used in either alpha or delta chains and are described by TRAV/DV symbols. Several V and J segments of the alpha locus are known to be incapable of encoding a protein and are considered pseudogenes.

An important paralog of this gene is IGHM.","Constant region of T cell receptor (TR) delta chain that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Gamma-delta TRs recognize a variety of self and foreign non-peptide antigens frequently expressed at the epithelial boundaries between the host and external environment, including endogenous lipids presented by MH-like protein CD1D and phosphoantigens presented by butyrophilin-like molecule BTN3A1. Upon antigen recognition induces rapid, innate-like immune responses involved in pathogen clearance and tissue repair (PubMed:28920588, PubMed:23348415). Binding of gamma-delta TR complex to antigen triggers phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 chains by the LCK and FYN kinases, allowing the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP70 that facilitates phosphorylation of the scaffolding proteins LCP2 and LAT. This lead to the formation of a supramolecular signalosome that recruits the phospholipase PLCG1, resulting in calcium mobilization and ERK activation, ultimately leading to T cell expansion and differentiation into effector cells (PubMed:25674089). Gamma-delta TRs are produced through somatic rearrangement of a limited repertoire of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes. The potential diversity of gamma-delta TRs is conferred by the unique ability to rearrange (D) genes in tandem and to utilize all three reading frames. The combinatorial diversity is considerably increased by the sequence exonuclease trimming and random nucleotide (N) region additions which occur during the V-(D)-J rearrangements (PubMed:24387714).

"SLC4A1","The protein encoded by this gene is part of the anion exchanger (AE) family and is expressed in the erythrocyte plasma membrane, where it functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger involved in carbon dioxide transport from tissues to lungs. The protein comprises two domains that are structurally and functionally distinct. The N-terminal 40kDa domain is located in the cytoplasm and acts as an attachment site for the red cell skeleton by binding ankyrin. The glycosylated C-terminal membrane-associated domain contains 12-14 membrane spanning segments and carries out the stilbene disulphonate-sensitive exchange transport of anions. The cytoplasmic tail at the extreme C-terminus of the membrane domain binds carbonic anhydrase II. The encoded protein associates with the red cell membrane protein glycophorin A and this association promotes the correct folding and translocation of the exchanger. This protein is predominantly dimeric but forms tetramers in the presence of ankyrin. Many mutations in this gene are known in man, and these mutations can lead to two types of disease: destabilization of red cell membrane leading to hereditary spherocytosis, and defective kidney acid secretion leading to distal renal tubular acidosis. Other mutations that do not give rise to disease result in novel blood group antigens, which form the Diego blood group system.

"CRYBB1","Crystallins are separated into two classes: taxon-specific, or enzyme, and ubiquitous. The latter class constitutes the major proteins of vertebrate eye lens and maintains the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Since lens central fiber cells lose their nuclei during development, these crystallins are made and then retained throughout life, making them extremely stable proteins. Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families; beta and gamma crystallins are also considered as a superfamily. Alpha and beta families are further divided into acidic and basic groups. Seven protein regions exist in crystallins: four homologous motifs, a connecting peptide, and N- and C-terminal extensions. Beta-crystallins, the most heterogeneous, differ by the presence of the C-terminal extension (present in the basic group, none in the acidic group). Beta-crystallins form aggregates of different sizes and are able to self-associate to form dimers or to form heterodimers with other beta-crystallins.

"HBA2","The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome 16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5'- zeta - pseudozeta - mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'. The alpha-2 (HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1) coding sequences are identical. These genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated regions. Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA, which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute HbA-2, which with HbF (fetal hemoglobin) makes up the remaining 3% of adult hemoglobin. Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.
