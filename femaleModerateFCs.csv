"FMOD","Fibromodulin belongs to the family of small interstitial proteoglycans. The encoded protein possesses a central region containing leucine-rich repeats with 4 keratan sulfate chains, flanked by terminal domains containing disulphide bonds. Owing to the interaction with type I and type II collagen fibrils and in vitro inhibition of fibrillogenesis, the encoded protein may play a role in the assembly of extracellular matrix. It may also regulate TGF-beta activities by sequestering TGF-beta into the extracellular matrix. Sequence variations in this gene may be associated with the pathogenesis of high myopia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

"MRPS35","Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit.

Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that has had confusing nomenclature in the literature. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

"CRYAA","Mammalian lens crystallins are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma families. Alpha crystallins are composed of two gene products: alpha-A and alpha-B, for acidic and basic, respectively. Alpha crystallins can be induced by heat shock and are members of the small heat shock protein (HSP20) family. They act as molecular chaperones although they do not renature proteins and release them in the fashion of a true chaperone; instead they hold them in large soluble aggregates. Post-translational modifications decrease the ability to chaperone. These heterogeneous aggregates consist of 30-40 subunits; the alpha-A and alpha-B subunits have a 3:1 ratio, respectively. Two additional functions of alpha crystallins are an autokinase activity and participation in the intracellular architecture. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Alpha-A and alpha-B gene products are differentially expressed; alpha-A is preferentially restricted to the lens and alpha-B is expressed widely in many tissues and organs.

This domain also permits interaction with members of the NuRD complex, a nucleosome remodeling protein complex that contains deacetylase activity. In addition, this repressor contains several RNA recognition motifs that confer binding to a steroid receptor RNA coactivator; this binding can modulate the activity of both liganded and nonliganded steroid receptors.

Is required for S phase entry of the cell cycle and survival of smooth muscle cells by inducing CCND1, resulting in RB1 phosphorylation. Binds to NBRE motif in CCND1 promoter, resulting in the activation of the promoter and CCND1 transcription (By similarity). Plays also a role in inflammation; upon TNF stimulation, mediates monocyte adhesion by inducing the expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 by binding to the NBRE consensus site (By similarity) (PubMed:20558821). In mast cells activated by Fc-epsilon receptor cross-linking, promotes the synthesis and release of cytokines but impairs events leading to degranulation (By similarity). Plays also a role in metabolism; by modulating feeding behavior; and by playing a role in energy balance by inhibiting the glucocorticoid-induced orexigenic neuropeptides AGRP expression, at least in part by forming a complex with activated NR3C1 on the AGRP- glucocorticoid response element (GRE), and thus weakening the DNA binding activity of NR3C1. Upon catecholamines stimulation, regulates gene expression that controls oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle (By similarity). Plays a role in glucose transport by regulating translocation of the SLC2A4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (PubMed:24022864). Finally, during gastrulation plays a crucial role in the formation of anterior mesoderm by controlling cell migration. Inhibits adipogenesis (By similarity). Also participates in cardiac hypertrophy by activating PARP1 (By similarity).

"CHN2","This gene encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-metabolizing protein that contains a phorbol-ester/diacylglycerol (DAG)-type zinc finger, a Rho-GAP domain, and an SH2 domain. The encoded protein translocates from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus membrane upon binding by diacylglycerol (DAG). Activity of this protein is important in cell proliferation and migration, and expression changes in this gene have been detected in cancers. A mutation in this gene has also been associated with schizophrenia in men. Alternative transcript splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants.
