"melanin","TYR","ENSG00000077498","The enzyme encoded by this gene catalyzes the first 2 steps, and at least 1 subsequent step, in the conversion of tyrosine to melanin. The enzyme has both tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa oxidase catalytic activities, and requires copper for function. Mutations in this gene result in oculocutaneous albinism, and nonpathologic polymorphisms result in skin pigmentation variation. The human genome contains a pseudogene similar to the 3' half of this gene.

Diseases associated with TYR include Albinism, Oculocutaneous, Type Ia and Albinism, Oculocutaneous, Type Ib.

An important paralog of this gene is TYRP1.","This is a copper-containing oxidase that functions in the formation of pigments such as melanins and other polyphenolic compounds. Catalyzes the initial and rate limiting step in the cascade of reactions leading to melanin production from tyrosine. In addition to hydroxylating tyrosine to DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), also catalyzes the oxidation of DOPA to DOPA-quinone, and possibly the oxidation of DHI (5,6-dihydroxyindole) to indole-5,6 quinone.

"melanin","OCA2","ENSG00000104044","This gene encodes the human homolog of the mouse p (pink-eyed dilution) gene. The encoded protein is believed to be an integral membrane protein involved in small molecule transport, specifically tyrosine, which is a precursor to melanin synthesis. It is involved in mammalian pigmentation, where it may control skin color variation and act as a determinant of brown or blue eye color. Mutations in this gene result in type 2 oculocutaneous albinism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
