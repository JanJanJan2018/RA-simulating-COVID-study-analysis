GSE152418, 34 samples, 18 females, 16 males, aged 23-91. One convalescent sample, and a mixed number of samples in moderate, severe, and ICU grades of COVID-19 infection symptoms. The previous files for how this data was obtained are 'covid19_GSE152418_76patients_1.Rmd', and '2' and '3' for updated versions. It says 76 patients, because I recopied some code from a prior study using GSE151161 on COVID-19 symptoms that are similar to Rheumatoid Arthritis patients that had 76 samples but actually only had 38 patients. 

This script is to test the topic modeling algorithm,linear discriminant analysis (lda), on these wide matrices of genes once we convert them to such. Caret will be used for the lda model.

We can use our functions find25genes and the other [geneCards2.R](https://github.com/JanJanJan2018/RA-simulating-COVID-study-analysis/blob/master/geneCards2.R) script has.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
monotonicIncrease <- read.csv('monotonicIncrease.csv',sep=',',
                      na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),header=T, stringsAsFactors = F)
monotonicDecrease <- read.csv('monotonicDecrease.csv',sep=',',
                      na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),header=T, stringsAsFactors = F)

HeaderInformation <- read.csv('HeaderInformation.csv',sep=',',
                              header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                              stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r}
head(HeaderInformation)
```



```{r}
monotonicIncreaseOrder10 <- monotonicIncrease[order(monotonicIncrease$ICU_health_foldChange,decreasing=T)[1:10],]

monotonicDecreaseOrder10 <- monotonicDecrease[order(monotonicDecrease$ICU_health_foldChange, decreasing=T)[1:10],]


colnames(monotonicIncreaseOrder10)
```

Lets only keep the actual samples for each class and set aside the convalescent sole sample.
```{r}
convalescentDecr <- monotonicDecreaseOrder10$convalescent
convalescentIncr <- monotonicIncreaseOrder10$convalescent

ensemblID <- monotonicIncreaseOrder10$ENSEMBLID

monotonicIncrease2 <- monotonicIncreaseOrder10[,c(3:35)]
monotonicDecrease2 <- monotonicDecreaseOrder10[,c(3:35)]

sampleType <- c(rep('healthy',17),rep('moderate',4),
                rep('severe',8),rep('ICU',4))
```

Make the two data frames matrices that flip the samples in the header for the rows and genes as the header from the EnsemblID feature.
```{r}
tIncr <- as.data.frame(t(monotonicIncrease2))
colnames(tIncr) <- ensemblID
tIncr$sample <- sampleType
IncreaseMx <- tIncr[,c(11,1:10)]
```



```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(8989)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=IncreaseMx$sample, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

trainingSet <- IncreaseMx[inTrain,]
testingSet <- IncreaseMx[-inTrain,]
dim(trainingSet)
dim(testingSet)
```

When using all 8088 genes as tokens for lda, it fails with accuracy and kappa values NA. So it was reduced to the top 10 highest fold change values in the ICU/healthy means. I origninally thought we were using the latent dirichlet allocation model of caret, but it is linear discriminant analysis of caret. This is why it fails. I do want to use the latent dirichlet allocation model, but it won't be in caret. It is another R package.
```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
IncreaseMx$sample <- as.factor(paste(IncreaseMx$sample))
set.seed(505005)

ldaMod <- train(sample~., method='lda', data=trainingSet,
                preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predlda <- predict(ldaMod, testingSet)

DF_ldaI <- data.frame(predlda, type=testingSet$sample)
DF_ldaI
```


```{r}
errored1 <- DF_ldaI[(DF_ldaI$predlda != DF_ldaI$type),]
errored1
```

```{r}
rn <- as.numeric(row.names(errored1))
rn
ldaError <- testingSet[rn,]
ldaError
```


```{r}
Inc_lda_wrong <- row.names(ldaError)
```



```{r}
lda_demg <- HeaderInformation[HeaderInformation$CN_new %in% row.names(ldaError),]
lda_demg
```

The three samples misclassified by lda in our 10 most expressed genes are two males aged 54 and 56 and one female aged 75.

When using the lda on only 10 of the most expressed genes in ICU/healthy mean values and genes that increased in expression with each more severe grade of COVID-19, there was an improvement from 5/9 correct to 6/9 for 67% accuracy.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(605040)
rf_boot <- train(sample~., method='rf', 
               na.action=na.pass,
               data=(trainingSet),  preProc = c("center", "scale"),
               trControl=trainControl(method='boot'), number=5)
```


```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
predRF_boot <- predict(rf_boot, testingSet)

DF_bootI <- data.frame(predRF_boot, type=testingSet$sample)


head(DF_bootI)
```


```{r}
errored2 <- DF_bootI[(DF_bootI$predRF_boot != DF_bootI$type),]
errored2
```

Lets see which samples created an error in our random forest model.
```{r}
rn <- as.numeric(row.names(errored2))
rn
rfError <- testingSet[rn,]
rfError
```


```{r}
RF_demg <- HeaderInformation[HeaderInformation$CN_new %in% row.names(rfError),]
RF_demg
```
The random forest model on the 10 most expressed genes got 4/9 wrong in the classification with two females aged 60 and 75, and two males aged 54 and 56.

```{r}
Inc_rf_wrong <- row.names(rfError)
```

***

Lets try lda with the 10 least expressed genes with monotonic increases across grades of COVID-19.

```{r}
tDecr <- as.data.frame(t(monotonicDecrease2))
colnames(tDecr) <- ensemblID
tDecr$sample <- sampleType
DecreaseMx <- tDecr[,c(11,1:10)]
```

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(8989)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=DecreaseMx$sample, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

trainingSet <- DecreaseMx[inTrain,]
testingSet <- DecreaseMx[-inTrain,]
dim(trainingSet)
dim(testingSet)
```

When using all 8088 genes as tokens for lda, it fails with accuracy and kappa values NA. So it was reduced to the top 10 highest fold change values in the ICU/healthy means.
```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
DecreaseMx$sample <- as.factor(paste(DecreaseMx$sample))
set.seed(505005)

ldaMod <- train(sample~., method='lda', data=trainingSet,
                preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predlda <- predict(ldaMod, testingSet)

DF_ldaD <- data.frame(predlda, type=testingSet$sample)
DF_ldaD
```


```{r}
errored3 <- DF_ldaD[(DF_ldaD$predlda != DF_ldaD$type),]
errored3
```

```{r}
rn <- as.numeric(row.names(errored3))
rn
ldaError <- testingSet[rn,]
ldaError
```

```{r}
decr_lda_wrong <- row.names(ldaError)
```


Lets use random forest on the decreasing genes data to see if it does any better to predict the ratings.
```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(605040)
rf_boot <- train(sample~., method='rf', 
               na.action=na.pass,
               data=(trainingSet),  preProc = c("center", "scale"),
               trControl=trainControl(method='boot'), number=5)
```


```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
predRF_boot <- predict(rf_boot, testingSet)

DF_bootD <- data.frame(predRF_boot, type=testingSet$sample)

head(DF_bootD)
```


```{r}
errored4 <- DF_bootD[(DF_bootD$predRF_boot != DF_bootD$type),]
errored4
```

Lets see which samples created an error in our random forest model.
```{r}
rn <- as.numeric(row.names(errored4))
rn
rfError <- testingSet[rn,]
rfError
```

```{r}
decr_rf_wrong <- row.names(rfError)
```


There was an improvement with the random forest on the decreasing data set's 10 genes with 6/9 correct. one sample each of moderate, severe and ICU were incorrect.

Lets see the age of those samples and gender with our header information.
```{r}
RF_demg <- HeaderInformation[HeaderInformation$CN_new %in% row.names(rfError),]
RF_demg
```
 
Two females aged 60 and 75 and one male aged 56 were the misclassified samples in the random forest model using the 10 least expressed genes by fold change of ICU/healthy means.

Lets compare which samples were misclassified in our testing set for the 10 least and most expressed genes in rf and lda.
```{r}
decr_lda_wrong;decr_rf_wrong; Inc_lda_wrong;Inc_rf_wrong
```

Ever model misclassified the 1st and 7th severe cases, the 1st moderate case and the 2nd ICU2 case was misclassified in the 10 least expressed genes using lda and the 10 most expressed genes using rf. The 14th healthy case was misclassified in the 10 least expressed genes using the lda model.
Lets see the demographics of those five samples.
```{r}
HeaderInformation[HeaderInformation$CN_new %in% decr_lda_wrong,]
```

This is where recall and precision would come in to play with precision based on number predicted disease over actual disease, and recall is the number of healthy misclassified as disease. We have three classes to choose from. 

precision: correctly predicted true positive/(true positive + false positive)
recall: correctly predicted true positive/(true positive + false negative)

The rf on 10 most:
```{r}
DF_bootI
```

```{r}
#healthy precision and recall and accuracy:
5/(5+2)
5/(5+0)
(5+2)/(5+2+2+0)

#moderate precision and recall and accuracy:
0/(1+0)
0/(1)
(0+8)/(0+8+1+0)

#severe pecision and recall and accuracy
0/(2+1)
0/(0+2)
(0+7)/(0+6+2+1)

#ICU precision and recall and accuracy
0/(0+1)
0/(0+1)
(0+7)/(0+7+1+1)
```
Manually the precision, recall, and accuracy was calculated for the four classes in the random forest model on the top 10 genes with a testing subset of 9 samples. The recall on the healthy class was 100% because all healthy classes were correctly identified as true positives, and there were no false negatives or healthy classes misclassified as another class.
The precision on the healthy class had 2 false positives, that classified 2 classes as healthy when they weren't. The accuracy on the moderate class was 88%, but there was only 1 class for the modified and none of the predicted classes was a moderate sample So its true negative rate was high for not classifying any classes as moderate. 

Lets make a function specific to our data frames to return the precision, recall, and accuracy of these four classes.
```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy <- function(df){
  
 colnames(df) <- c('pred','type')
  df$pred <- as.character(paste(df$pred))
  df$type <- as.character(paste(df$type))
  
 classes <- unique(df$type)
 
 class1a <- as.character(paste(classes[1]))
 class2a <- as.character(paste(classes[2]))
 class3a <- as.character(paste(classes[3]))
 class4a <- as.character(paste(classes[4]))
 
  #correct classes
  class1 <- subset(df, df$type==class1a)
  class2 <- subset(df, df$type==class2a)
  class3 <- subset(df, df$type==class3a)
  class4 <- subset(df, df$type==class4a)
  
  #incorrect classes
  notClass1 <- subset(df,df$type != class1a)
  notClass2 <- subset(df,df$type != class2a)
  notClass3 <- subset(df,df$type != class3a)
  notClass4 <- subset(df, df$type != class4a)
  
  #true positives (real positives predicted positive)
  tp_1 <- sum(class1$pred==class1$type)
  tp_2 <- sum(class2$pred==class2$type)
  tp_3 <- sum(class3$pred==class3$type)
  tp_4 <- sum(class4$pred==class4$type)
  
  #false positives (real negatives predicted positive)
  fp_1 <- sum(notClass1$pred==class1a)
  fp_2 <- sum(notClass2$pred==class2a)
  fp_3 <- sum(notClass3$pred==class3a)
  fp_4 <- sum(notClass4$pred==class4a)
  
  #false negatives (real positive predicted negative)
  fn_1 <- sum(class1$pred!=class1$type)
  fn_2 <- sum(class2$pred!=class2$type)
  fn_3 <- sum(class3$pred!=class3$type)
  fn_4 <- sum(class4$pred!=class4$type)
  
  #true negatives (real negatives predicted negative)
  tn_1 <- sum(notClass1$pred!=class1a)
  tn_2 <- sum(notClass2$pred!=class2a)
  tn_3 <- sum(notClass3$pred!=class3a)
  tn_4 <- sum(notClass4$pred!=class4a)
  
  
  #precision
  p1 <- tp_1/(tp_1+fp_1)
  p2 <- tp_2/(tp_2+fp_2)
  p3 <- tp_3/(tp_3+fp_3)
  p4 <- tp_4/(tp_4+fp_4)
  
  p1 <- ifelse(p1=='NaN',0,p1)
  p2 <- ifelse(p2=='NaN',0,p2)
  p3 <- ifelse(p3=='NaN',0,p3)
  p4 <- ifelse(p4=='NaN',0,p4)
  
  #recall
  r1 <- tp_1/(tp_1+fn_1)
  r2 <- tp_2/(tp_2+fn_2)
  r3 <- tp_3/(tp_3+fn_3)
  r4 <- tp_4/(tp_4+fn_4)
  
  r1 <- ifelse(r1=='NaN',0,r1)
  r2 <- ifelse(r2=='NaN',0,r2)
  r3 <- ifelse(r3=='NaN',0,r3)
  r4 <- ifelse(r4=='NaN',0,r4)
  
  #accuracy
  ac1 <- (tp_1+tn_1)/(tp_1+tn_1+fp_1+fn_1)
  ac2 <- (tp_2+tn_2)/(tp_2+tn_2+fp_2+fn_2)
  ac3 <- (tp_3+tn_3)/(tp_3+tn_3+fp_3+fn_3)
  ac4 <- (tp_4+tn_4)/(tp_4+tn_4+fp_4+fn_4)
  
  table <- as.data.frame(rbind(c(class1a,p1,r1,ac1),
                         c(class2a,p2,r2,ac2),
                         c(class3a,p3,r3,ac3),
                         c(class4a,p4,r4,ac4)))
  
  colnames(table) <- c('class','precision','recall','accuracy')
  
  return(table)
  
  
}
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_bootI)
```

Note in the above results how accuracy can be much higher than precision and recall, because if there are 9 samples, and only one class of a sample, than not selecting that class only produces an error in accuracy of 1/9 for that class which is 11% error or 89% accuracy in prediction for that class. As we saw for the 'moderate' class when it wasn't predicted at all but was only in one test sample to predict.  

The rf on 10 least:
```{r}
DF_bootD
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_bootD)
```

In the above results, the 'severe' class only got 1 out of 3 predicted samples as 'severe' right so it received a 33% in precision, and out of all classes that were 'severe', it only got 1 out of 2 of them correct and missed one class so its recall was 50%.


The lda on 10 most:
```{r}
DF_ldaI
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_ldaI)
```


The lda on 10 least:
```{r}
DF_ldaD
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_ldaD)
```

We know that we need to eliminate some of these genes from our most and least expressed gene set of 10 genes. We will do that later and test our prediction accuracy. 

This script was designed to see if the lda model would allow a very wide and short data frame or matrix to be used as a tokenized natural language processing data frame but for genes. Unfortunately, I used the linear discriminant analysis (lda) model of caret and so it would fail because of the curse of dimensionality and having more features than samples. Right from the start our 8089X34 dimension matrix failed the lda modeling for missing accuracy and kappa values. I didn't tune the model at all or use any hyperparameters other than the center and scaling features of the preprocessing attribute in caret. It could possibly work if those hyperparameters were tuned. But the huge curse of dimensionality type matrix will never work in linear discriminant analysis. It would divide 8800+ features from one data frame into 4 groups with linear boundaries. Imagine how it fails. Latent dirichlet allocation is an NLP algorithm, thats for natural language processing, and this lda kind of model could use in simulating our gene numeric data as integers for counts of 'words' known as tokens instead of weighted counts like the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency use of words. https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html is a good source to test out the LDA. I have used it before in other scripts, but it has been a while and thought caret had the package from previous work and information on caret. When I wanted to use linear discriminant analysis I couldn't find it and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Now when I want to use latent dirichlet allocation it's not the package I thought it was.

Instead, we explored the 10 most and least expressed genes that are also increasing or decreasing monotonically from lowest severe case of COVID-19 to most severe case of COVID-19. The machine learning classification was about the same as our other work immediately preceding this script that used the 20 most and least expressed genes by fold change only. Also, this script didn't use the functions in our geneFunctions2.R script to merge these genes with the Human Genome Nomenclature (HGNC) gene symbol we are more familiar with instead it kept the Ensembl gene symbol.

We should look at this data in Tableau and see if some genes pop out as useful or not, and also consider those samples that threw off the classifications, and possibly tuning or testing out on different hyperparameters of our ML models to see if we can improve. But doing the resampling could lead to overfitting if we generalize too much it won't predict the classes well. 

Accuracy of the model overall could be improved, the healthy samples naturally had a better precision and recall as they had more samples out of all the classes. A few samples in particular were of two females and a male that were 56 or older, we could try leaving those samples out to see if they are outliers or data that skews the mean values and ultimately the fold change values. 

The topics are defined from a library to to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the same wide matrices can be used with a grid search and tokenized words used in recommender systems and sentiment review but with random forest, neural nets, and gradient boosted machines. These caret algorithms were very fast compared to how they have behaved with my work in the past. I recommend trying out Latent Dirichlet to model the classes as topics or using the  tokenized formats of sentiment analysis and recommender systems' machine learning algorithms. My next extension of this study will explore those areas. Possibly with Python using reticulate to access Python in R.



***

I made a couple of Tableau charts and uploaded them to the Tableau Public Server to share. 

The first chart is a comparison of the mean values across all three classes of COVID-19 with a highlighted fold change value of the ratio of disease to healthy means and are monotonically decreasing with fold change values at least 30. 

<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/janis5126#!/vizhome/monotonicDecreaseCOVID19casesBarchart/monotonicDecrease?publish=yes" target="_blank">Tableau External Window</a>


![monotonically Decreasing Genes](./images/monotonicDecrease.png)



The next chart is a chart of the most monotonically increasing fold change expression genes with at least 30 in fold change.

<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/janis5126#!/vizhome/MonotonicIncreaseCOVID19casesBarchart/monotonicIncrease?publish=yes" target="_blank">Tableau External Window</a>


![monotonically increasing genes](./images/monotonicIncrease.png)

Each link will take you to the image's chart to hover the details. What is missing is the details of the Ensembl ID's HGNC gene symbol with annotations for what those genes do. Lets import those charts data that was done earlier and saved to this document's folder contents.

```{r}
mDecr <- read.csv('monotonicDecrease_Full_Data_data.csv',sep=',',
                  header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                  stringsAsFactors = F)
head(mDecr)

```

```{r}
mIncr <- read.csv('monotonicIncrease_Full_Data_data.csv',sep=',',
                  header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                  stringsAsFactors = F)
head(mIncr)
```

Lets change the 1st column name to 'Moderate.Mean' in both data frames to remove that symbol changed in downloading the Tableau chart data.
```{r}
colnames(mDecr)[1] <- 'Moderate.Mean'
colnames(mIncr)[1] <- 'Moderate.Mean'
```


Now lets source our functions to grab the gene symbols from genecards.org and the annotations.
```{r}
source('geneCards2.R')
```

Lets make a list of the Ensembl genes from both tables. They are not the same genes because if you are monotonically increasing as a gene, you cannot also monotonically decrease from least to most severe cases of COVID-19 sampled fold change values.
```{r}
decrList <- as.character(mDecr$Ensemblid)
incrList <- as.character(mIncr$Ensemblid)

geneList <- as.character(c(decrList,incrList))
geneList
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
for (i in geneList){
  find25genes(i)
}
```



```{r,eval=FALSE}
files <- list.files('./gene scrapes')[1:16]
files
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
for (i in files){
 file <- paste('./gene scrapes',i, sep='/')
 t <- read.csv(file,sep=',',header=F)
 write.table(t,file='monotonic1genes.csv',sep=',',append=T,col.names=F,row.names=F)
}
```

```{r}
monotonic1genes <- read.delim('monotonic1genes.csv',header=F,sep=',',na.strings=c('',' ','NA'))
monotonic1genes$V2 <- toupper(monotonic1genes$V2)
colnames(monotonic1genes) <- c('gene','EnsemblGene','DateSourced')
monotonic1genes <- monotonic1genes[,-3]
```


```{r}
head(monotonic1genes)
```


We will extract the gene summaries now.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
for (i in monotonic1genes$gene){
  getSummaries(i,'PBMC')
}
```


```{r,eval=FALSE}
getGeneSummaries('PBMC')
```

```{r}
monotonicSumms <- read.csv("proteinGeneSummaries_pbmc.csv",sep=',',
                           header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                           stringsAsFactors = F)
monotonicSumms <- monotonicSumms[,2:5]

head(monotonicSumms)
```

Merge the two retrieved data frames by gene to add to our numeric data of fold change values.
```{r}
montcData <- merge(monotonic1genes,monotonicSumms,by.x='gene',
                   by.y='gene')
```

```{r}
head(montcData)
```

Now combine to numeric fold change data.
```{r}
montcData2 <- rbind(mIncr,mDecr)
montcData3 <- merge(montcData,montcData2, by.y='Ensemblid',
                    by.x='EnsemblGene')
head(montcData3)
```

Lets write this out to csv and create the same charts but add the annotations and gene symbol.
```{r}
write.csv(montcData3,'monotonicIncDecrSumms.csv',row.names=FALSE)
```


Now that I have the new data with summary annotations with the gene symbol instead of the Ensembl ID, I have made the Tableau charts and uploaded them to Tableau Public Server.

The first chart is the monotonically decreasing genes selected with moderate fold change values greater than 20. Hovering on each bar and disease state will give the mean value, fold change value also on the labels respective to each disease state, and the Entrez gene summary for the gene. There is an image of the chart without hovering over any bar on the barchart, and also an image of the chart when hovering over any bar on the barchart for that gene and disease state.

Next, Lets see if we can use machine learning with just the random forest model and three of the top increasing and decreasing genes to classify the class of COVID-19 severity.

***


Lets create some conditional features to this data.
```{r}
montcData3$percentBW_MSI <- ifelse((montcData3$mod.health.foldChange>1.5*
                          montcData3$sevr.health.foldChange & 
                          montcData3$sevr.health.foldChange>1.5*
                          montcData3$ICU.health.foldChange),1,0)
montcData3$percentBW_ISM <- ifelse((montcData3$mod.health.foldChange<.5*
                          montcData3$sevr.health.foldChange & 
                          montcData3$sevr.health.foldChange<.5*
                          montcData3$ICU.health.foldChange),1,0)

```

We have our three least and most expressed genes, lets now get those genes.
```{r}
least3 <- montcData3$gene[montcData3$percentBW_MSI==1]
most3 <- montcData3$gene[montcData3$percentBW_ISM==1]
```

Our ML genes are:
```{r}
ML_genes <- c(as.character(paste(least3)),as.character(paste(most3)))
ML_genes
```

```{r}
ML_DF_leastMost <- subset(montcData3,montcData3$gene %in% ML_genes)
ML_ensmbl_LstMst <- ML_DF_leastMost[,1:2]
ML_ensmbl_LstMst
```

Lets import the original data, when extracting these genes in Tableau using the filters, it wasn't the same filtering principles used in the creation of our 10 most and least monotonic genes by fold change.
```{r}
originalDF <- read.delim('GSE152418_p20047_Study1_RawCounts.txt',sep='\t',
                       header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                       stringsAsFactors = F)
```

```{r}
colnames(originalDF)
```

Lets look at our header information on the demographics of each samples again.
```{r}
HeaderInformation
```

```{r}
cn <- as.data.frame(colnames(originalDF)[2:35])
colnames(cn) <- 'originalNames'
cn$originalNames <- gsub('[.]','-',cn$originalNames,perl=T)
cn2 <- HeaderInformation[,2:3]
newColumnNames <- merge(cn,cn2,by.x='originalNames',by.y='CN_old')
```

change the names back once merged to merge back with originalDF and new names.
```{r}
newColumnNames$originalNames <- gsub('-','.',
                                     newColumnNames$originalNames,
                                     perl=T)
```


```{r}
DF1 <- merge(ML_ensmbl_LstMst,originalDF,by.x='EnsemblGene',
             by.y='ENSEMBLID')
DF2 <- DF1[,-1]
row.names(DF2) <- DF2$gene
DF3 <- DF2[,-1]
DF4 <- as.data.frame(t(DF3))
DF4$sample1 <- row.names(DF4)
DF5 <- merge(DF4,newColumnNames, by.y='originalNames',by.x='sample1')
row.names(DF5) <- DF5$sample1
ML_dataframe3s <- DF5[,-1]
head(ML_dataframe3s)
```

```{r}
aliases <- ML_dataframe3s$CN_new
ML_dataframe3s$CN_new <- gsub('[0-9]','',ML_dataframe3s$CN_new)
```


Now lets see how this new set of genes is at predicting our classes of COVID-19.
Lets remove the convalescent class first.
```{r}
ML_dataframe3s$CN_new <- as.factor(paste(ML_dataframe3s$CN_new))
row.names(ML_dataframe3s) <- NULL

```


```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(9875)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=ML_dataframe3s$CN_new, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

trainingSet <- ML_dataframe3s[inTrain,]
testingSet <- ML_dataframe3s[-inTrain,]
dim(trainingSet)
dim(testingSet)
```
Lets first test how well lda predicts the convalescent sample from training all the data samples.
```{r}
convalescent <- subset(ML_dataframe3s, ML_dataframe3s$CN_new=='convalescent')
```

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

ldaMod <- train(CN_new~., method='lda', data=ML_dataframe3s,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predlda <- predict(ldaMod, convalescent)

DF_ldaConvalescent <- data.frame(predlda, type=convalescent$CN_new)
DF_ldaConvalescent
```



```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_ldaConvalescent)
```

Given that the LDA model predicted healthy when it did have data to train on only 1 out of 34 samples having this class, the model predicted the class of the convalescent class to be healthy. Maybe it is a misclassification of a sample. The above shows the accuracy measures. Lets try the random forest model too.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

rfMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rf', data=ML_dataframe3s,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predrf <- predict(rfMod, convalescent)

DF_rfConvalescent <- data.frame(predrf, type=convalescent$CN_new)
DF_rfConvalescent
```

Interestingly the random forest model, predicted the convalescent class to be its own class of 'convalescent' and it also had one sample of 'convalescent' to train on this class. Likely it is because the values in this sample are identical to the values in the testing set because it is the exact sample. 
```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_rfConvalescent)
```

The above measures show that the precision, recall, and accuracy were 100%. What if we made the testing sample a multicollinear version of itself and test the rf model? Lets multiply it by e.
```{r}
convalescent2 <- convalescent
convalescent2[,1:6] <- exp(convalescent2[,1:6])
```


```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

rfMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rf', data=ML_dataframe3s,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predrf <- predict(rfMod, convalescent2)

DF_rfConvalescent2 <- data.frame(predrf, type=convalescent2$CN_new)
DF_rfConvalescent2
```

When we changed the convalescent sample to the exponential function or natural number, e, of itself, the random forest classified this sample as moderate. We will assume the sample is healthy or moderate and not its own class of convalescent.

If we remove the convalescent sample to train on in the random forest model, will it predict moderate or healthy or a more severe form? Lets also change the class to moderate in the convalescent testing set.
```{r}
MLDF <- subset(ML_dataframe3s, ML_dataframe3s$CN_new!='convalescent')
MLDF$CN_new <- as.character(paste(MLDF$CN_new))
MLDF$CN_new <- as.factor(MLDF$CN_new)
DFc <- convalescent[,1:6]
DFc$CN_new <- as.factor(paste('moderate'))
```

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

rfMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rf', data=MLDF,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predrf <- predict(rfMod, DFc)

DF_rfConvalescent3 <- data.frame(predrf, type=DFc$CN_new)
DF_rfConvalescent3
```
The random forest model predicted the convalescent class to be healthy. It says moderate, because I had to change the class level or the model threw and exception error and also I had to reclass the 5 factor levels original to the subset of our training data to 4 factors, because it remembers the omitted class of convalescent. So in the previous chunck the outcome feature was reclassed as character then reclassed as factor to omit the remembered class of 'convalescent.' 

We can do the same thing by reclassifying it as healthy for the convalescent class and see if it works in all the data using the random forest model to classify the convalescent class as healthy.
```{r}
MLDF2 <- ML_dataframe3s
MLDF2[MLDF2$CN_new=='convalescent',7] <- 'healthy'
MLDF2$CN_new <- as.character(paste(MLDF2$CN_new))
MLDF2$CN_new <- as.factor(MLDF2$CN_new)
DFc <- convalescent[,1:6]
DFc$CN_new <- as.factor(paste('healthy'))
```

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

rfMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rf', data=MLDF2,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predrf <- predict(rfMod, DFc)

DF_rfConvalescent4 <- data.frame(predrf, type=DFc$CN_new)
DF_rfConvalescent4
```

So we see that throwing in the convalescent sample as a healthy sample didn't affect the outcome of the random forest model predicting it as a healthy label. Lets go ahead and keep this dataset, MLDF2, with the convalescent sample as a healthy sample.
```{r}
grep('convalescent',ML_dataframe3s$CN_new)
```

We know that the original sample for convalescent is observation or row 12 in our data. Lets test these new genes on classifying our four classes of data and see if we can see an improvement from our other models. 
```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(9875)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=MLDF2$CN_new, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

trainingSet <- MLDF2[inTrain,]
testingSet <- MLDF2[-inTrain,]
dim(trainingSet)
dim(testingSet)
```



```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

rfMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rf', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predrf <- predict(rfMod, testingSet)

DF_RF <- data.frame(predrf, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_RF
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_RF)
```

Nope! Not an improvement using these genes. Lets see how lda does and knn.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

LDAMod <- train(CN_new~., method='lda', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predLDA <- predict(LDAMod, testingSet)

DF_LDA <- data.frame(predLDA, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_LDA
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_LDA)
```

The LDA model scored slightly better in precision and recall as well as accuracy in the severe class and the same for the healthy class.Now for the knn model.

```{r,error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

KNNMod <- train(CN_new~., method='knn', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predKNN <- predict(KNNMod, testingSet)

DF_KNN <- data.frame(predKNN, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_KNN
```

```{r}
precisionRecallAccuracy(DF_KNN)
```

The KNN model didn't score any better with these genes for each sample, but slightly worse than the random forest and lda models. Lets see if we can use gbm and rpart for a difference. GBM is what I think is the gradient boosted machines and glm we could also try is the generalized linear models and rpart is a type of trees algorithm for recursive partitioned trees possibly similar to decision trees that don't build the trees as in depth as the random forest trees. 

The rpart model:
```{r,eval=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

RPARTMod <- train(CN_new~., method='rpart', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='cv'))
predRPART <- predict(RPARTMod, testingSet)

DF_RPART <- data.frame(predRPART, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_RPART
```
The rpart model produced an 'undefined columns' error with these settings.


The gbm model:
```{r,eval=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

GBMMod <- train(CN_new~., method='gbm', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='cv'))
predGBM <- predict(GBMMod, testingSet)

DF_GBM <- data.frame(predGBM, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_GBM
```
The gbm model also produced a 'Something is wrong; all the Accuracy metric values are missing' error.


The glm model:
```{r,eval=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
set.seed(505005)

GLMMod <- train(CN_new~., method='glm', data=trainingSet,
                trControl=trainControl(method='boot'))
predGLM <- predict(GLMMod, testingSet)

DF_GLM <- data.frame(predGLM, type=testingSet$CN_new)
DF_GLM
```

The GLM model also produced the same error as the gbm model with missing accuracy and kappa metric values.

***


Lets move on to finding out the human body systems like Vitamin D and melanin, and see how they behave in the moderate, severe, and ICU cases compared to the healthy cases by way of our already calculated fold change values. We can use our functions find25genes and the other [geneCards2.R](https://github.com/JanJanJan2018/RA-simulating-COVID-study-analysis/blob/master/geneCards2.R) script has. 



I added the above function to our geneCards2.R sourced script file of functions. This should reset the folder 'gene scrapes' that the supplementary files are in too. Resource the script everytime you don't need the supplementary files from another run, and want fresh files.
```{r}
source('geneCards2.R')
```

```{r, eval=F}
find25genes('vitamin D')
find25genes('melanin')
```

```{r, eval=F}
getProteinGenes('vitamin D')
getProteinGenes('melanin')
```



```{r}
vitD <- read.csv( "Top25vitamin-ds.csv")
melanin <- read.csv("Top25melanins.csv")
```


```{r}
vitD3 <- vitD[1:3,1:2]
mel3 <- melanin[1:3,1:2]

integumentary <- rbind(vitD3,mel3)
head(integumentary)
```

```{r, eval=F}

  getSummaries2(i,'vitamin D')
}
for (i in mel3$proteinType){
  getSummaries2(i,'melanin')
}
```


```{r, eval=F}
getGeneSummaries('vitamin D')
getGeneSummaries('melanin')
```

```{r}
vitD3summs <- read.csv("proteinGeneSummaries_vitamin-d.csv")
mel3summs <- read.csv("proteinGeneSummaries_melanin.csv")
```

```{r}
vitDmel_summs <- rbind(vitD3summs,mel3summs)
head(vitDmel_summs)
```


```{r}
vitD_melanin <- vitDmel_summs[,c(1:6)]
vitD_melanin

```

```{r}
origFCs <- read.csv('DATA_FCs_GSE152418.csv',sep=',',
                    na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                    stringsAsFactors = F)
sun <- merge(vitD_melanin,origFCs, by.x='EnsemblID',
             by.y='ENSEMBLID')
sun
```

Great lets write this out to csv and use it to put together some quick Tableau charts.
```{r}
write.csv(sun,'sunGenes.csv',row.names=F)
```


<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/janis5126#!/vizhome/sunGenesCOVID19/vdrSunGenesCOVID19?publish=yes" target="_blank">Tableau External Window</a>

Each of the following are from the same chart comparing sun Gene values in COVID-19 cases and VDR does increase with the severity of the case. The top outlier was subsequently exluded within Tableau to knock down the outlier genes, but hovering gives the names and gene summary as well as lableded fold change values of the disease/healthy mean ratio for each respective disease class.

![image 1 sun Genes with VDR at the top](./images/sun1.png)


![image 2 sun Genes with VDR excluded and PHEX as the highest healthy mean value showing](./images/sun2.png)


![image 3 sun Genes with PHEX and VDR excluded](./images/sun3.png)

![image 4 sun Genes with PHEX, VDR, and CYP27B1 excluded](./images/sun4.png)


Lets look at the data in another way. I want to gather the columns and combine with the demographic information. But first, there are two genes in the vitamin D genes' top 3 ranked from genecards.org, PHEX and VDR, that increase in fold change in the cases of moderate, to severe, to ICU for COVID-19, and one melanin gene, TYR.
```{r}
sun[,c(2:4,45:47)]
```



```{r}
sunGathered <- gather(sun, key='sampleType',value='geneValue',7:40)
head(sunGathered)
```

```{r}
sunData <- merge(HeaderInformation,sunGathered,by.x='CN_new',
                 by.y='sampleType')
write.csv(sunData,'sunData.csv',row.names=FALSE)
```

An interesting chart showing the raw values of gene expression for the three melanin and Vitamin D genes top ranked by genecards.org was created and shared on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/janis5126#!/vizhome/SunGenesDemographicsRawValues/SunGenesDemographics?publish=yes" target="_blank">Tableau Public Server</a>

We can see some genes decrease with age and others increase, also the gender differences as a color dimension shows changes in gene expression by gender. Take a look at the link above in Tableau and the images below to this chart.

![Demographics of Sun Genes](./images/melD1.png)

In the first image above, there is one outlier for a 76 year old gene when looking at the melanin gene OCA2 labeled severe8 that has much more of this gene expressed than other severe cases. But this gene's values tend to fluctuate on a cases by case basis for each severe sample.

![Demographics of Sun Genes with Entrez gene summary](./images/melD2.png)


![Demographics of Sun Genes Female outlier Vitamin D](./images/melD3.png)

The details when hovering will be displayed if you select a scatter point to give the severity of the case and corresponding sample in that group.
The last image shows with age for both females and males the CYP27B1 increases except for a female in her 60s identified as severe4 in the severity raw values of this gene. And a 54 year old male labeled as severe1 is also not following the increase with age.But otherwise this gene CYP27B1 increases with age in both genders within the severe and ICU severe cases, while decreasing with age in the moderate cases. In healthy cases there is not a recognizable pattern as it varies with age and gender.




***


Lets not stop at the sun genes, as a massage therapist of more than 14 years of experience and having recently studied for and taken and passed my MBLEx or Massage and Bodywork Licensing Examination, I can tell you there are many fascinating items of the body systems and mineral as well as vitamin dependencies that lead to disease in some people. But when relearning the endocrine system and the hormones related to the pineal, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals, thyroid, and pancreas many other vitamins, steroids, and hormones should be looked at in studying these different cases of COVID-19.

We will look at the Vitamin C which helps the body absorb Vitamin D and make calcium in the bone blood, the glucagon that turn glucose into sugar and insulin that lowers glucose in the blood having to do with the pancreas hormones, dopamine that relates to parkinsons disease when the hypothalamus doesn't produce enough, melatonin that regulates sleep and produced by the pineal gland near the pituitary and hypothalamus in the brain that regulates sleep, estrogen, prolactin, and progesterone regulated by the pituitary gland in the brain in females, testosterone regulated by the males in their testes, and corticosteroids and adrenaline regulated by the adrenals when in sympathetic response of danger in the body. Also, the vitamins that people are commonly told to take in addition to Vitamin C and Vitamin D, such as fish oil or omega 3s, vitamin B12 or zinc, and magnesium mineral.Also, calcitonin, a thyroid hormone that breaks down calcium so that the kidneys don't get kidney stones nor other healthy problems.

Lets use our data we created earlier with our fold change modified values for Inf, NaN, and 0 when z/0, 0/0,0/z where z is any rational number and the alternate value was replaced in respective case with disease mean, 1, or healthy mean.

```{r}
dataAllFCs <- read.csv('DATA_FCs_GSE152418-monotonicGenes.csv',sep=',',header=T, na.strings=c('',' ','NA'),
                       stringsAsFactors = F)
colnames(dataAllFCs)
```

That is a lot of genes to combine with our find25genes function and summarise, so lets just get the vitamins, minerals, and hormones we are interested in first, combine those into a data set and then add the HGNC gene symbol and the summaries to plot and discuss our findings.

Some of the genes associated with one vitamin also associate with another. We will keep them this way for the visualizations or charting.We could make a link analysis with these genes that are associated with other vitamins and minerals, but if not then you should.

Lets now get the gene summaries of these genes.
```{r,eval=F}
for (i in vitMinSter$proteinType){
  getSummaries2(i,'protein')
}
```


```{r,eval=F}
getGeneSummaries('protein')
```

I only want the 2nd through 6th features.
```{r}
vitMinSterSumms <- read.csv("proteinGeneSummaries_protein.csv"
)
```


```{r}
vitMinSterSumms2 <- vitMinSterSumms[,2:6]
head(vitMinSterSumms2)
```

Combine the vitamin searched with the gene from the last two data frames.
```{r}
vitamins <- merge(vitMinSter,vitMinSterSumms2,
                  by.x='proteinType',
                  by.y='gene')
vitamins2 <- vitamins[!duplicated(vitamins),]
head(vitamins2)
```

Lets now combine this dataframe with the Ensembl ID of the dataAllFCs dataframe.
```{r}
vitaminsDF <- merge(vitamins2,dataAllFCs,
                    by.x='EnsemblID',
                    by.y='ENSEMBLID')
head(vitaminsDF)
```

We are ready to make are charts from this data to analyze any pattern, relationships, outlier samples, and make hypothesese on. Lets write this data frame out to csv.
```{r}
write.csv(vitaminsDF,'vitaminsDF.csv',row.names=FALSE)
```

Lets also attach the header demographic information and tidy the sample types into one column.
```{r}
vitDF <- gather(vitaminsDF,key='sampleName',value='sampleValue',7:40)
```


```{r}
vitDF2 <- merge(HeaderInformation,vitDF,by.x='CN_new',
                by.y='sampleName')
```


```{r}
write.csv(vitDF2,'vitaminsTidyDF.csv',row.names=F)
```


I have created some visualizations that were uploaded to Tableau Public Server to view for these genes as a bar with fold change values, those genes that are only increasing in fold change by severity, and then those that are only decreasing in fold change by severity from least to worst or moderate to severe to ICU. The scatter plot has the age and gender as added dimensions, and all summaries of the genes are displayed when hovering over that feature.

There are many relationships that can be seen and understood by looking at the gene trends within the proteins and those increasing or decreasing by severity of COVID-19 when viewing the interactive plots in Tableau at the links provided before each image above.

After adding the iron genes to our data, it was charted by fold change values and also by raw values, age, gender, and severity of COVID-19 disease.


<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/janis5126#!/vizhome/ironCovid19AgeGenderSeverityScatter/ironCovid19AgeGenderSeverityScatter?publish=yes" target="_blank">Scatter of gene values by severity, age, and gender</a>

![scatter of genes](./images/ironScatterAgeGenderSeverity.png)

The image above is the chart of genes in Tableau that has only the iron actual raw values for its top 3 ranked genes in our samples. We can see that the first gene is much higher over all in expression in healthy samples, and that in all three grades of severity of COVID-19 the iron levels are on the smaller range decreasing with age in both genders and all cases excep the ICU grade for females where it increased with age. The 2nd iron gene is similar except that iron increases with age in females. The last iron gene shows that it is lower in healthy samples and than the other two iron genes, but in ICU grades of COVID-19 it is increased.

![nonMonotonic Genes-Iron](./images/ironNonMonFCs.png)

This image above is of those iron genes that aren't monotonically increasing or decreasing. There fold change values are shown for each gene and all are under expressed in the disease state compared to the healthy state. We created the rules for these fold change values so that if the disease state mean was 0 and the healthy mean was not 0, the fold change would be 1-healthy mean, and if both the disease state and the healthy state means were 0 then the fold change value would be 1, and finally if the healthy mean was 0 but the disease mean was not 0 the value would be the disease state. And if the fold change was not 0, Inf, or NaN, then the value would stay as is from the disease state/healthy state ratio of mean values. We can see from the image of the Tableau chart, that the iron gene was clicked on and selected to 'keep only' so that only the iron genes are displayed among those nonmonotonic. HFE and SLC11A2 are shown, and the ICU grade of COVID-19 severity is lower than the severe grade of COVID-19, but the moderate grade is lower than the ICU grade in the HFE gene and higher in the SLC11A2 gene. SLC11A2 is involved in transporter activity and copper ion binding and associated with anemia (not enough red blood cells). While HFE is associated with hemochromatosis (too many red blood cells) and signaling receptor binding as well as peptide antigen binding.

The image above is of those genes monotonically increasing but with iron selected as the 'keep only' gene to be displayed. We can see the description of this gene that is one of the top three ranked iron genes, SLC40A1, as associated with hemochromatosis Type I and Type 4, iron ion transmembrane transporter activity, and its related pathways include mineral absorption and insulin receptor recycling.

We already have this chart, because it is the monotonically increasing genes from least to most severe grades of COVID-19, except that iron was added to the data set and coincidentally not in this chart because its three genes are split between the monotonically decreasing and the genes nonmonotonic. Look at the genes that are higher in the least severe case and dramatically lower in the most severe case. Most are hormones, but one is a fish oil gene and a couple of vitamin B12 genes that aren't dramatically higher in the moderate compared to the ICU grade of COVID-19. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are gender related hormones. The testosterone gene GNRH1 is produced in the hypothalamus which lies in front of the pituitary gland that produces estrogen and progesterone. Synthetic progesterone is consumed when eating legumes and yams. Adrenaline is the sympathetic hormone produced by the adrenal glands and released in times of extreme stress or fight or flight threats to personal safety. If you explore the chart further you will see that TNF is a corticosteroid and vitamin C gene that is dramatically higher in moderate cases than in ICU cases of COVID-19.
